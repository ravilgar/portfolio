It's a pleasure to try to make any project well done, to be sure that the created web app will look great to any user. And to see the result! I love the pace at which new things appear in the frontend - the improvement of the Javascript language, the birth and development of various frameworks, the intersection with mobile development, and so on. Isn't it cool? That's why I chose the frontend as something in which I'm growing."
